🔒 GAIA PROJECT — PRIVACY POLICY

Last updated: 17th November 2025

1. Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how the Gaia Project AI Agent (“the Bot”, “we”, “us”) handles information when users interact with it on Telegram.

We are committed to protecting user privacy, minimising data collection, and ensuring transparency in how the Bot operates.

By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described in this Policy.

2. What Information We Collect

The Bot only collects the minimum information required to function.

2.1 Telegram User Information

When you interact with the Bot, Telegram automatically sends us:

Your Telegram user ID

Your username (if available)

Your first name and/or last name (if available)

The messages you send to the Bot

Any replies or mentions involving the Bot

For group chats, messages tagged directly to the Bot

2.2 Solana Wallet Queries

If you ask the Bot to run a Solana command (e.g., /sol balance <wallet>):

The wallet address you provide is processed

Public blockchain data is retrieved

No private keys, signatures, or sensitive wallet data are ever collected

We never ask for, store, or require private keys.

2.3 Local Memory Storage

The Bot stores chat history locally for the purpose of remembering past conversations.
This includes:

Your Telegram name/username

Your messages

The Bot’s responses

This memory helps personalise interactions.

No data is stored in the cloud or shared with third parties.

3. Why We Collect This Information

We store and process user interactions solely to:

Personalise responses

Improve the accuracy and context of the Bot

Maintain continuity in conversations

Allow the Bot to function as intended

Provide Solana blockchain lookups on request

We do not use your data for marketing, selling, analytics, or external advertising.

4. Who Has Access to the Data

Access to stored data is strictly limited to:

The project owner/developer of the Gaia Project

Automated systems required to run the Bot (e.g., local server, OpenAI API)

No one else has access.

We do not share, sell, trade, or disclose your information to third parties.

The only external system that receives your messages is:

OpenAI, for generating replies

Messages are processed to generate responses

OpenAI does not use your data to train models unless you have opted in

5. How Long Data Is Stored

Chat history is stored locally for as long as needed to maintain conversational memory.

You may request data deletion at any time (see Section 8).

6. Security Measures

We take the following precautions:

All data is stored locally on a controlled server

No data leaves the system except messages sent to OpenAI for generation

Private keys or sensitive wallet data are never requested or stored

Access is restricted to the developer only

However, no system is fully immune to risks, and you use the Bot at your own discretion.

7. Children’s Privacy

The Bot is not intended for children under 13.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

8. Your Rights

You can request:

A copy of your stored data

Correction of your data

Deletion of your memory file

To make a request, contact the project owner through the community’s official channels.

9. Third-Party Services

The Bot interacts with:

Telegram (to receive messages)

OpenAI (to generate responses)

Solana RPC providers (to retrieve blockchain data)

Each has its own privacy policy.

We do not control their data handling.

10. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated as the project evolves.

Continued use of the Bot after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.

11. Contact
